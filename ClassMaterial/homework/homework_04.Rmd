## Parts 1 and 2: Examining discrimination in hiring continued


On homework 3 you used a **randomization hypothesis test**,
to investigate whether resumes that had names that were perceived to
be White received callbacks at a higher rate than applicants that had names
that were perceived to be Black. 

On parts 1 and 2 of this homework, you will compare **randomization**  and
**parametric** hypothesis tests to investigate whether resumes that had names
that are perceived to be female receive callbacks at the same rate as applicants
that are perceived to be male.

To do this analysis, we will again use the data collected by Bertrand and
Mullainathan in their study in the [American Economic
Review](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873). If you have forgotten the design of
the study, please refer back to homework 3.





$\\$






**Part 1: Challenge question**: 

**All components of part 1 together comprise a "challenge problem" that you should try to figure out without getting help from the TAs.**


To begin comparing randomized and parametric tests, we must first run a 
randomization hypothesis test that examines whether the callback rate for
resumes that had stereotypical female names was the same as callback rate for
resumes that had stereotypical male names. This problem is very similar to 
problem 1 from homework 3 so if you get stuck please refer back to homework 3.
Also, since this analysis similar to what you did on homework 3, you should 
complete this problem without help from the TAs (i.e., it's a "challenge problem").

In order to have more consistent answers from different students, (to make the
grading easier), we have outlined the steps you should take, names of key objects
you should use, and values you should print out. In particular, it is important
to use the same object names discussed since we will refer to these objects in
subsequent parts of the homework.




$\\$




**Part 1.1: State the null and alternative hypothesis (2 points)**

Please state the null and alternative hypotheses in words and symbols, along
with the significance level we typical use.

Note: we are testing whether there is **a difference** in the callback rate for
resumes that had stereotypical female names compared to resumes that had
stereotypical male names, rather than testing that one of these rates is higher
than the other. Please be sure to state your hypotheses, and run your analyses,
appropriately.




**In words**






**In symbols**






$\\$







**Part 1.2: Calculate the observed statistic (2 points)**

The observed statistic is the difference in the callback rates for resumes with
stereotypical female names and the callback rate for resumes with stereotypical
male names. Please save the difference in these callback rates to an object
called `obs_stat`. Print out this rate, along with the female and male
callback rates, in the R chunk below.



```{r male_female_callback_rates}

load("resume.rda")





```




$\\$




**Part 1.3: Create the null distribution (3 points)**

Please use the `rbinom()` functions to randomly create an (approximate) null
distribution that has 10,000 points in it. Save this null distribution in an
object called `null_dist`. Also, plot the null distribution as a histogram and
put red vertical lines at the value of the observed statistic and the value
of -1 times the observed statistic.


```{r resume_null_dist}












```




$\\$




**Part 1.4: Calculate the p-value (2 point)**

Now calculate the p-value and print it below. 



```{r rand_resume_pval}





```




$\\$




**Part 1.5: Conclusion (1 point) **


Based on the p-value you calculated describe whether there is evidence to reject
the null hypothesis and consequently what you would conclude.



**Answer**









$\\$








## Part 2: Comparing randomization tests to parametric methods


Now let's continue to analyze the same questions as in part 1, by rerunning our
analyses using a parametric hypothesis test. To do this we will again use the
same 5 steps of hypothesis testing, but we will use a mathematical density
function for the null distribution rather than creating the null distribution by
generating random data.



$\\$




**Part 2.1: state the null and alternative hypothesis (1 point)**

In order to consistently go through the steps of hypothesis testing, please
start with step 1 by restating the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols
here (you can skip writing them in words). Please also state again the
significance level required for us to reject the null hypothesis.










$\\$





### Part 2.2: Calculate the observed statistic (5 points)


We can use the same statistic as in part 1 (i.e., a difference in proportions)
to run a parametric hypothesis test. The mathematical theory tells us that the
difference of proportions should come from a normal distribution. As you recall,
a normal distribution has two parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$. The mathematical
theory also tells us that if the null distribution is true (which we always
assume when we are running a hypothesis test, and attempt to "disprove" through
testing), then:

1. The value for $\mu$ is equal to the value specified in the null hypothesis
2. The standard error of our null distribution is given by the formula:

$$SE = \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n_1} +  \frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n_2} }$$

Where:
 * $\hat{p}$ is the overall proportion of resumes that received callbacks regardless of whether
resume had a stereotypical male or female name.
 * $n_1$: Is the number of resumes with stereotypical male names.
 * $n_2$: Is the number of resumes with stereotypical female names.


A tip: If you have trouble reading formulas in raw LaTeX notation, it may be 
helpful to first knit the homework and view the PDF output of the same formula 
to make sure you understand the equation.

Since we have already calculated the observed statistic in part 1.2 above, let's
use the R chunk below to calculate the theoretical standard error value for the
null distribution, save it to an object called `SE_prop`, and print out this value.


Side note: An alternative way to run this analysis would be to use a z-statistic
statistic which is the difference in proportions divided by the SE. You likely
have seen this type of analysis in the Introductory Statistics class you took (a
test that uses this statistic goes by the name of a z-test). This type of
z-statistic comes from a standard normal distribution; i.e., a normal
distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The reason we are
not doing this here is because we want to compare our parametric null
distribution to the randomization null distribution we created in part 1.4.
Another alternative would have been to use a z-statistic in part 1 of this
homework by calculating the SE using the formula above and then using it to
convert our difference of proportion statistics to a z-statistic by dividing by
the SE.



```{r SE_prop}






```






$\\$






### Part 2.3: Create/visualize the null distribution (5 points)

Now let's visualize the parametric null distribution's density function and
compare it to the randomization null distribution we created in part 1.3. Please
complete the following steps to do this:

1. Create a sequence of x-values that cover the domain of where the density
function is above ~0. Hint: the `seq()` function could be useful here.

2. Create a sequence of y-values that correspond to the density values for the
x-values you created in step 1. Hint: recall density functions start with the
letter `d` and think through what the density function is, and what the
parameter values should be based on the information given in part 2.2.

3. Plot a histogram of the null distribution as you did in part 1.3 

4. Use the `points()` function to plot the density curve that you created in
steps 1 and 2 above. Hint: the `points()` function works the same as the
`plot()` function except that it plots on top of an existing plot rather than
creating a new plot.

5. In the answer section below, write 1-2 sentences stating whether the
parametric density curve we are using for the null distribution appears similar
to the null distribution we created by generating random statistics.


```{r parametric_null_dist}








```


**Answer**: 







$\\$




### Part 2.4: Calculate the parametric p-value (5 points)

Now calculate the p-value using the appropriate parametric density curve and
print out this p-value. In the answer section describe where this p-value is
similar to the p-value you got in part 1.4.

Hint: a function that starts with the letter `p` will be useful here. 



```{r parametric_pval}






```


**Answer** 




$\\$




### Part 2.5: Conclusions (2 points)

Based on the p-value you calculated in part 2.4, describe whether there is
evidence to reject the null hypothesis and consequently what you would conclude.
Did the randomization test lead to different results from the parametric test?




**Answer**








$\\$






## Part 3: Analyzing data using t-tests


The term "Freshman 15" refers to the belief that college students frequently
gain weight during their freshman year (i.e., it is believed that students gain
15 lbs). To test whether students do in fact gain weight during their first year
at college, David Levitsky, a Professor of Nutrition at Cornell College,
recruited students from an introductory health course. The students were weighed
during the first week of the semester, then again 12 weeks later.

The data from 68 students in Professor Levitsky’s class is loaded below and
contains the following variables:

- `Subject`: An ID number for each participant who volunteered their weight.
- `Initial.Weight`: The weight of each participant at the start of the semester.
- `Terminal.Weight` The weight of each participant at the end of the semester.

Let's run a few t-tests to see if students do indeed gain any weight (on average)
over the course of the semester. Though the term is called "freshman 15," our
analysis will investigate if students gain any weight at all.


```{r part_3_0}

freshman <- read.table("freshman-15.txt", header = TRUE)

```




$\\$




**Part 3.1 (3 points)**: 

Let's start by running an "independent samples" t-test where we treat the
initial weight and final weight as independent samples. Although the final
weight and initial weight are not independent, because they are measurements of
the same subjects across different points in time, we will first assume they are
independent here for practice running independent t-tests and observing the
outcome of the "independent samples" t-test.

Please start with step 1 by stating the null and alternative hypothesis
in words and using our commonly used symbols.


**Answer**









$\\$




**Part 3.2 (6 points)**: 

Now let's visualize the data and calculate the statistic of interest. Please use
an appropriate plot to compare the students' weights at the start and end of the
semester. Also calculate and store the value of the statistic in an object
called `t_stat`, and report its value. Recall for Welch's t-test, the
t-statistic is defined as:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n2}}}$$

where:
- $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$ are the means of the two groups.
- $s^2_1$ and $s^2_2$ are the variances of the two groups.
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the samples sizes of the two groups.


Based on the plot, does it seem that students gain weight? 


Note: as before, if you have trouble reading the above equation, please knit
this document to a pdf, and you should then be able to zoom in on the equation
(and also see the class slides).


```{r part_3_2}








```


**Answer** 






$\\$






**Part 3.3 (6 points)**: 

To run Welch's t-test, the following conditions need to be met:  

1. The data come from normal populations, or, as a rule of thumb, the sample
sizes for the two groups are greater than 30.

2. Like all hypothesis tests we run, we assume that data points within each
group are independent (we will ignore any dependence between the two samples for
this analysis).


If these conditions are met, the t-statistic should come from a null
t-distribution with (conservative) degrees of freedom of the minimum of $n_1$ -
1 and $n_2$ - 1.

Please plot this null t-distribution below, and draw a red line at the observed
t-statistic value you calculated in part 3.2. Based on the plot you created,
does it appear that the results will be statistically significant?

```{r part_3_3}






```

**Answer** 







$\\$





**Part 3.4 (3 points)**: 

Now calculate the p-value (hypothesis test step 4). Report below whether the
results are statistically significant (hypothesis tests step 5). Also report
what you would conclude.


```{r part_3_4}



```

**Answer**







$\\$






**Part 3.5 (3 points)**: 

R has a built in function to do a t-test called `t.test(sample1, sample2)`.
Please print out the results from running this function and report:

1. Do you get the same t-statistic value as you computed above in part 3.2?
2. Do you get the same p-value as you computed above in part 3.4? 
3. If you get any different results, what could be causing the difference? Hint:
take a look at the documentation for the function by running `?t.test` in the R
console.



```{r part_3_5}



```

**Answer**

1. 

2. 

3. 




$\\$





## Part 4: Paired t-test

As you likely noticed in part 3, the "Freshman 15" data discussed in part 3 is
based on repeated measures from the same participants. We can leverage this fact
to run a paired samples t-test which is much more powerful (i.e., it has a much
higher ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false). The reason the
paired samples t-test is so much more powerful is because there is a lot of
variability between different people in the study, so if we can factor that out
and only focus on the weight gained by each person, we will have a much better
chance of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is false.

The paired samples t-test assesses whether the difference between two
measurements on the same observational units is 0 on average (it can also be
used to test if the difference is another value apart from 0, but that is less
common). To run this test, we first calculate the difference score for each
participant between the two measurements. We then calculate the follow
t-statistic:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_d}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

where:
- $\bar{x}_d$ is the mean of the difference scores 
- $s_d$ is the standard deviation of the difference scores 
- $n$ is the number of samples (where each sample represents one person 
  and consists of two values -- their initial weight and final weight)

Provided that the difference scores are approximately normal (or n is large),
and that, as always, the data points are independent, then the t-statistic
should come from a t-distribution with n - 1 degrees of freedom.


In this exercise, please use the 5 hypothesis steps to run a paired t-test on
the freshman 15 data. As part of your analysis, be sure to print out value of
your t-statistic and the p-value you calculate. Also, please solve this problem
without using the `t.test()` function (i.e., calculate the t-statistic, use the
`pt()` function etc.), however you can use the `t.test()` to check that you have
the right answer.
