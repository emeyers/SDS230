## Part 1: Examining discrimination in hiring


A study by Bertrand and Mullainathan in the [American Economic
Review](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873) examined discrimination in the job
market. In the study, the researchers randomly generated information such as
years of experience and education details to create a realistic-looking resumes.
They then randomly assigned a name to the resume that would communicate the
applicant's gender and race. The first names chosen for the study were selected
such that the names would predominantly be recognized as belonging to Black or
White individuals. For example, Lakisha was a name that their survey indicated
would be interpreted as a Black woman, while Greg was a name that would
generally be interpreted to be associated with a White male. They then sent the
resumes out to jobs posted in Boston and Chicago newspapers and observed whether
there were differences in how frequently employers gave a callback based on the
perceived race and gender of the applicant.

In the first exercise, you will use the data collected by Bertrand and
Mullainathan to run a hypothesis test to assess whether there is evidence
that applicants that are perceived to be White have a higher callback rate than
applicants that are perceived to be Black. 

Credit: An analysis of this data was described in the book 'Quantitative Social
Science An Introduction' by Imai, and the data comes from the [OpenIntro Data
Sets](https://www.openintro.org/data/). 





$\\$





**Part 1.1 (5 points)**: To start the analysis, please state the null and
alternative hypotheses for testing whether applicants whose names are perceived
to be White have a higher callback rate than applicants whose names are
perceived to be Black using both words and in the appropriate symbols that we
have discussed in class. Also, please state whether this study is an
observational study or an experiment, and why.

Note: We are using the term "callback rate" to mean the proportion of resumes
that received callbacks from potential employers.




**Answer**: 


**The null and alternative hypothesis in words**







**The null and alternative hypothesis in symbols**












$\\$






**Part 1.2 (8 points) **: The data from the Bertrand and Mullainathan study is
loaded below. To learn more about the data, including seeing a data dictionary,
type `? resume` in the console after the data has been loaded.

Please complete the following steps to calculate the main observed statistic of
interest for our hypothesis test:

1. Create an object called `race` that contains the data in the `race` variable
in the `resume` data frame. Also create an object called `callback` that has the
data from `callback_received` variable in the `resume` data frame. For the
`callback` data, a 1 indicates the resume received a callback from an employer,
while a 0 indicates that the resume did not receive a callback.

2. Calculate the proportion of resumes that received callbacks from resumes that
had names that were perceived to be White (i.e, the White name callback rate),
and the proportion of resumes that received callbacks from resumes that had
names that were perceived to be Black (i.e., the Black name callback rate).
Print out these rates and then create an object called `obs_stat` that has the
difference of the White and Black name callback rates. Report what the value of
the observed statistic is in the answer section below using the appropriate
symbol we have used in class. From just looking at this statistic value, state
whether you believe there will be statistically significant evidence of a
difference in these rates.

Hint: there are several ways to do calculate the callback rates. Reviewing the
material from the first three classes could be helpful here. Also, depending on
the method you use, it could be important to remember that R is case sensitive.



```{r part_1_2}
  
# load the data
load("resume.rda")


# 1. Extract the relevant vectors for the resume data frame



# 2. Calculate the White and Black name callback rates and the difference of these rates










```


**Answer**: 








$\\$






**Part 1.3 (15 points) **: Now let's use the `rbinom()` function to generate a
null distribution that would be expected if the null hypothesis was true. To do
this, please complete the following steps:

1. Calculate the overall callback rate that ignores the perceived race of the
name on the resume. Save this overall callback rate to an object called
`overall_callback_rate`. This is the callback rate that would be expected if the
rate was the same for resumes with stereotypical White and Black names (i.e., it
is the callback rate consistent with the null hypothesis).

2. Calculate the number of resumes in the Bertrand and Mullainathan data that
have stereotypical White names and save this to an object called `size_white`.
Likewise, calculate the number of resumes that have stereotypical Black names
and save this to an object called `size_black`.

3. Use the `rbinom()` to generate 10,000 simulated callback rates for the
resumes with stereotypical White names that are consistent with the null
hypothesis and save this an object called `null_white_rates`. Likewise the
`rbinom()` to generate 10,000 simulated callback rates for the resumes with
stereotypical Black names that are consistent with the null hypothesis and save
this an object called `null_black_rates`. Then calculate the null distribution
by subtracting the `null_black_rates` from the `null_white_rates` and save this
to an object called `null_distribution`.

4. Plot the null distribution as a histogram and add a vertical line at the
observed statistic value.

5. In the answer section below, state whether you believe you will be able to
reject the null hypothesis based on looking at the plot you created in step 4.


Hints: 

1. The `rbinom()` returns counts of the number of successes out of "size" coin
flips. You can turn this into rates (i.e., proportions) by dividing the maximum
possible value that `rbinom()` can return.

2. If you subtract two vectors of numbers `v1` and `v2` then each element of
vector `v1` is subtracted from the element of vector `v1` at the same index
location.

3. The arguments to `rbinom(num_sims, size, prob)` are: 

 * `num_sims`: the number of simulations to run.
 * `size`:  the number of "coin flips" in each simulation.
 * `prob`:  the probability of getting heads on each coin flip. 


```{r part_1_3}


# 1. calculate the `overall_callback_rate`



# 2. create size_white and size_black objects




# 3. create the null distribution




# 4. plot the null distribution




    
        
```

**Answer**








$\\$






**Part 1.4 (5 points)**: Now, use the `null_distribution` and the `obs_stat`
objects to calculate the number of simulations that had a difference of
proportion that was as high or higher than the observed statistic. Convert this
to a p-value by dividing by the total number of simulations. Describe whether
this p-value provides sufficient evidence that resumes with names generally
perceived as White receive callbacks at a higher rate than resumes with names
generally perceived as Black.


```{r part_1_4}








```


**Answer**: 








$\\$





**Part 1.5 (12 points)**: Now use the bootstrap to calculate a 95% confidence
interval for the callback rate for resumes with names generally perceived as
White. In the answer section, report whether your best point estimate for the
proportion of callback for resumes with names generally perceived as Black falls
in this confidence interval.

Hint: Creating a vector of the callbacks for White sounding names is a good
first step in the analysis.


```{r part_1_5}
    

  # create a vector for the callback data for only resumes with stereotypical White names




  # create the bootstrap distribution 



   
  

  # plot the bootstrap distribution




  
  # create the confidence interval





  
  
   
```


**Answer**: 








$\\$






**Part 1.6 (5 points)**: There is also a formula for calculating the standard
error of a proportion which is:


$SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$


Use this formula to create 95% confidence intervals for the callback rate for
resumes with names generally perceived as White, and compare it to the 95%
confidence intervals you calculated in the previous problem. Describe in the
answer section below whether the two methods for calculating confidence
intervals lead to similar results.


```{r part_1_6}





```


**Answer** 






$\\$






**Bonus (0 points)**:

Explore the data set further and see if you can discover any other interesting
results from the study.

## Part 2: Do diamond prices differ depending on the quality of the cut? 


In 2018, the total global wholesale value of polished diamonds amounted to
almost [25.3 billion U.S.
dollars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/612251/wholesale-value-of-polished-diamonds-worldwide/).
The price of an individual diamond can be affected by several factors including
the diamond's color, clarity, size and the quality of how it was cut. In this
exercise, we will examine data from a large set of diamonds to assess whether
the quality of the cut of a diamond affects the average price.



$\\$




**Part 2.0 (4 points)** 

The code below loads a data frame called `diamonds` that comes from the ggplot2
package, which is a package that is used to visualize data (we will discuss this
package soon). For more information about the data set see [this
website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html).

In the exercises below we will compare the mean price of diamonds, for two
different levels of the diamond's cut. The levels of cut we are going to compare
are the `Fair` cut diamonds (which is the worst cut), and the `Ideal` cut
diamonds, which is the best cut. To start this analysis, create a object called
`fair_price` that contains the prices for all the diamonds corresponding to the
`Fair` cut, and a vector object called `ideal_price` that contains the prices
for all the diamonds corresponding to the `Ideal` cut. If done correctly, the
`fair_price` vector should have 1,610 elements, and the `ideal_price` vector
should have 21,551 elements in it.

Also, report in the answer section below, how many cases and variables the full
`diamonds` data frame has (the `dim()` function can help with this) and also
whether you think the prices for the `Ideal` cut diamonds will be higher than
the prices for `Fair` cut diamonds. Finally, please state whether this study is
an observational study or an experiment and why.



```{r diamond_data}

library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)







```


**Answer**: 







$\\$





In parts 2.1 to 2.5 you will now do the 5 steps to run a hypothesis test!



$\\$




**Part 2.1 (5 points)** Let's start our hypothesis testing in the usual way by
stating the null and alternative hypotheses using words and symbols. Although
you might have a prior expectation that one of the diamonds' cuts will have a
higher average price than the other, please state the alternative hypothesis in
a non-directional way, such that you are testing whether the average prices of
the `Fair` cut and `Ideal` are different, and not that one price is higher than
the other. When running your hypothesis test below, also do the analysis in such
a way that you are doing a non-directional test (i.e., you will calculate the
p-value by looking at both tails of the distribution).

Finally, write down the significance level using the appropriate symbol, and set
it to the most commonly used value.



**Answer**:  








$\\$









**Part 2.2 (4 points)**  Now calculate the value of that observed statistic that
is appropriate for this analysis. In the answer section, write down the value
for this statistic and use the appropriate notation to denote this statistic.
Also, visualize the data by creating a side-by-side box plot comparing the two
groups. Based on this plot, describe in the answer section whether you believe
there is a difference in mean prices.


```{r diamonds_stat}

 






```

**Answer**:  







$\\$







**Part 2.3 (12 points)**  Now create a null distribution using a permutation
test. To do this, combine data from both groups, randomly assign the data to a
fake "fair" and "ideal" groups, calculate a null statistic, and repeat 10,000
times to get a null distribution. Also, plot a histogram of the null
distribution and add a red vertical line to the plot at the value of the
observed statistic. Based on this plot, do you think the average diamond price
is the same between the two cuts?

Hint: You can randomize using the sample() function.

```{r diamonds_null}






















```


**Answer** 






$\\$






**Part 2.4 (5 points)** Now calculate the p-value in the R chunk below. Be sure
that you calculate the p-value using both tails (which should be consistent with
how you stated the null hypothesis). Is this the p-value you would expect based
on the plot of the null distribution and observed statistic in part 2.3?

```{r diamonds_pvalue}








```


**Answer** 







$\\$







**Part 2.5 (4 points)** Are the results statistically significant? Do you
believe there is a difference between these groups? Are these results surprising
at all? Please answer these questions below.



**Answers**:  








$\\$




**Part 2.6 (5 points) Challenge problem** 


**This is a "challenge problem" that you should try to figure out without
getting help from the TAs. Challenges problems might be more difficult than
other problems but they won't be worth too many points, so they will not have a
large impact on your homework score.**


From looking at the observed statistic, we notice that the fair cut diamonds
actually have a higher price than the ideal cut diamonds! This is strange since
one would expect diamonds that have a better cut would cost more. Try examining
the full diamonds data frame and see if you can come up with a reason why it
might be the case that fair cut diamonds cost more.

Once you have identified another reason why the prices might be higher for the
fair cut diamonds, create a plot that gives evidence that your explanation makes
sense, and describe in the answer section below what is causing these strange
results. Hint: use boxplots, scatterplots and/or other types of plots you see
fit to explain the price difference.


```{r challenge}










```
