## About the data you will analyze on this homework


In this homework you will analyze data from a cognitive science experiment that
examined how the human visual system processes information. In particular, it is
well known that when an object is very visually distinct from its surroundings,
the object appears to "pop-out" and humans can rapidly identify the object.
However, it is not known whether reaction times are affected by the position of
where the object appears, or if having multiple irrelevant distractor objects
affects reaction times. Understanding how humans process different visual stimuli
could lead to better computer vision systems and could give insight into
neural disorders (e.g., simultanagnosia).

The data you will analyze was collected in an experiment run by students at
Hampshire College in the spring of 2017. In the experiment, participants were
shown images of diamond shapes on a screen, where one side of the diamond was
cut off (see images below). If the left side of the diamond was cutoff,
participants had to press the "z" key, and if the right side of the diamond was
cut off, participants had to press the "/" key. Participants needed to respond
as quickly and as accurately as possible to these images.

On some trials only a single diamond was shown. On other trials a "salient"
diamond of one color was presented with 8 other "distractor" diamonds of a 
different color, and participants needed to respond to the diamond that had a 
unique color. The diamonds appeared in one of 9 locations (in a 3 x 3 grid), and 
the diamonds were either red or green. 

**Our analyses on this homework will focus on whether reaction times were
affected by the position of the salient diamond, and whether reaction times were
affected by the presence of distractor diamonds.**

The study was done using a "factorial design" where all permutations of each
condition were shown in blocks of 72 stimuli. A complete experiment consisted of
10 blocks (720 stimuli in total). The stimuli conditions that made up each block
were:

1. `position` (9 levels): The position where the target (popout) stimulus appeared.

2. `condition` (2 levels): Whether a trial was a isolated stimulus trial, or
whether it as a cluttered trial where distractors also appeared.

3. `color` (2 levels): The color of the target stimulus that participants needed
to respond to, which could be red or green. When present, the distractor stimuli
were always the opposite color as the target stimulus (e.g., if the target was
red, then the distractors were all green).

4. `cur_dir` (2 levels): whether the right or left side of the diamond was cut
off. This also indicates whether the participants needed to press the "z" or "/"
key. The cut off sides of all the distractors stimuli were random chosen and
irrelevant for the task.

In addition to these factor variables that describe the stimulus conditions
present on each experimental trial, the data frame also contains the
quantitative variable `reaction_time` that measures participants' reaction times
on each trial in milliseconds. The `reaction_time` will be the response variable
(y) that we will model as a function of some of the explanatory variables listed
above (namely the `position` and `condition` variables). Finally, the data frame
had a few additional variables, including the `participant` variable, which is
an unique ID for each of the 8 participant who participated in the study. On the
final problem on this problem set, you might want to explore these additional
variables.


**Important Note:** The data from this experiment has not yet been published, so
please do not share this data outside of the class.

shows an isolated trial with a green target (popout) stimulus. Since the left
side of the diamond is cut off, participants need respond by pressing the "z"
key. The image on the right shows a cluttered trial with a red target (popout)
stimulus. Since the right side of the popout target diamond is cut off,
participants need to respond by pressing the "/" key.](popout_stimuli.png)

## Part 1: One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for testing more than two means

To start we will run an one-way analysis of variance to see if mean reaction
times differ depending on the spatial position of where an object appeared on
the screen. The positions of where the objects could appear on the screen are
shown in the schematic below, where position 1 means the upper left corner of
the screen, position 8 is the lower middle of the screen, etc.

|     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  1  |  2  |  3  |
|  4  |  5  |  6  |
|  7  |  8  |  9  |


The data set is loaded in the R chunk below and some basic processing is applied
to simplify the data set. For the purpose of our analyses, we will only analyze
trials where the salient ("pop-out") item did not appear at the central location
(i.e, we will not analyze data from position 5).

```{r popout_data}

# load the data
load('popout_data.rda')


# simplify the data set a little 
popout_data <-  popout_data |>
  na.omit() |>
  filter(position != 5) |>
  mutate(position = droplevels(position))


dim(popout_data)


```

**Part 1.1 (3 points)**: 


Let's start running our one-way ANOVA in the same way we run all hypothesis
tests, namely by stating the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and
words. Also state the alpha level that is most commonly used.



**Answers**


**In words**




**In symbols**





**The significance level**






$\\$





**Part 1.2 (4 points)**:

Now that you have stated your hypotheses, you are ready to begin analyzing the
data. A first useful step in doing this is to visualize the data, so please use
ggplot to create a box plot that shows reaction times as a function of the 8
different positions we are analyzing.

From looking at your visualization, in the answer section please discuss whether
you think there is a statistically significant difference in mean reaction times
depending on position.


```{r visualize_position_rt}





```

**Answer** 





$\\$






**Part 1.3 (4 points)**: In order for the F-distribution to be a valid null
distribution for our F-statistic, two conditions must be met which are:

1. The variances (or standard deviations) in each group must be approximately the same.  
2. The data from each group must be relatively normal.  

Also, as with almost all hypothesis tests, the data points need to be
independent, which we will assume is the case here.

One can check these conditions either at the start of the analysis, or at the
end before one draws a final conclusion. Let's check these conditions now!

We can check the first condition, as to whether the variances within each group
are approximately the same, by comparing the standard deviations of reaction
times within each group (position). As long as the largest standard deviation is
not twice as big as the smallest standard deviation this condition is roughly
met. Please use dplyr to check this condition, and print the standard deviations
for each position as well as the ratio between the largest and smallest standard
deviation. In the answer section below, describe whether this condition appears 
to be met.


```{r check_anova_conditions1}








```


**Answer** 





$\\$





**Part 1.4 (6 points)**: We can check the second condition, as to whether the
data is relatively normal in each group, by visually inspecting the data. We
could do this in a few ways, including by creating a histogram of the residuals
or by creating a Q-Q plot of the residuals. Here, the residuals are the
difference between each point and its group mean.

To create these plots it will be useful to first create a data frame called
`popout_residuals` that is derived from the `popout_data` data frame. Like the
`popout_data` data frame, every row in `popout_residuals` represents a single
trial, but `popout_residuals` also has two additional variables. The first
variable is called `group_mean_rt` and should have the mean reaction time for
each group (position). The second variable is called `rt_residuals` and should
contain the difference between the reaction time for each trial and the mean
reaction time for the corresponding position (i.e., the values in the
`group_mean_rt` variable). Using the `group_by()` function in conjunction with
the `mutate()` function will be helpful for adding these variables to the data
frame.

Once you have created the `popout_residuals` data frame, create the Q-Q plot
using the `qqnorm()` function. Based on this visualization, do the residuals
appear normally distributed?

Note: as discussed in class, the ANOVA is fairly robust to departures from
homoscedasticity and normality, particularly for large data sets. However it is
still useful to check these conditions.


```{r check_anova_condition2}











```


**Answer**






$\\$






**Part 1.5 (6 points)**: 

As you should see from looking a the Q-Q plot of the residuals, the residuals do
not appear to be that normally distributed. In particular, reaction times are
always positive values, and is often the case with data that only has positive
values, the data is right skewed.

To deal with this right skew, please create a transformed version of the
reaction times, by taking their natural log using the `log()` function. In
particular, create a new data frame called `popout_log_data` that is the same as
the original `popout_data` except that the values in the `reaction_time`
variable should be log transformed. Then, use the `popout_log_data` to recreate
the `popout_residuals` data frame on the log transformed data, and then use this
data to recreate the Q-Q plot of the residuals to show that the residuals are
now more normally distributed.

For all the analyses in the rest of the problem set, please use the
`popout_log_data` data frame since this transformed data more closely matches
the ANOVA conditions.


```{r check_transformed_data}















```





$\\$





**Exercise 1.6 (5 points)**: Let's now use R's `lm()` function to run an ANOVA.  
Running an ANOVA and creating table requires two steps:

1. We must fit a model using the syntax: `fit <- lm(response_variable ~ categorical_predictor, data = my_data)`

2. We can then print an ANOVA table using `anova(fit)`

Please use the `lm()` function to fit a model that predicts reaction times from
the different stimulus positions (using the `popout_log_data`). Save the model that
you fit to an object called `fit_position`. Then use the `anova()` function to
print out the ANOVA table. 

From looking at the output of the ANOVA table, are you able to reject the null 
hypothesis? In the answer section, report what would you conclude in terms of 
how reaction times vary with position of the pop-out stimulus.


```{r r_diagnositcs}





```


**Answer** 







$\\$





**Exercise 1.7 (7 points)**: Let's also visualize the null distribution for
this hypothesis test. To create the appropriate F-distribution, use the degrees
of freedom specified in the ANOVA table created in 1.6. Then use either base R 
graphics or ggplot to plot the F-distribution density function (you can get the 
density values using the `df()` function), and add the observed statistic as a red
vertical line to the plot. 

Also, calculate the p-value using the `pf()` function, and F-statistic and 
appropriate degrees of freedom from the ANOVA table in part 1.6. Does the p-value
match what is shown in the ANOVA table, and also does the p-value match you would 
expect based on the plot of the null distribution? 


```{r F_null_distribution}










```



**Answer**







$\\$





**Exercise 1.8 (5 points)**: 

Finally, let's create a few diagnostic plots to examine our ANOVA fit on the log 
transformed reaction time data to give insights into whether the ANOVA assumptions 
are met on this data (i.e., whether the residuals are normally distributed with 
equal variance). 

To do this, please use the `plot()` function on the `fit_position` model you 
created above to create diagnostic plots. In the answer section, describe what 
is determines the x-axis location of the points in the residuals vs. fitted 
values plot (i.e., in the upper left plot).


```{r check_fit}







```

**Answer**: 







$\\$







## Part 2: Two-way analysis of variance 


Let's now run a two-way ANOVA to assess at once whether position and cluttered
displays can affect reaction times.
  




$\\$




**Part 2.1 (9 points)**:  Start your hypothesis test by stating the
null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words. State these null and
alternative hypotheses for the main effect of position, the main effect of
whether the condition is an isolated or cluttered trial, and also for the
interaction effect of position and whether the condition is an
isolated/cluttered trial (i.e., you should have 3 sets of hypotheses).



### Main effect for position

**In words**




**In symbols**




### Main effect for isolated/cluttered condition




**In symbols**







### Interaction effect for position and isolated/cluttered



**In words**






**In symbols**






$\\$






**Part 2.2 (4 points)**: 

Now fit a model **that only has main effects** for position and
isolated/cluttered condition (i.e., that does not contain an interaction term).
Are the main effects statistically significant?


```{r two_way_main_effects}






```

**Answer** 





$\\$





### Part 2.3 (6 points): Interaction effects

Now let's visualize the data to see if there is an interaction between position
and isolated/cluttered condition.

Use the `interaction.plot()` function to visualize the position on the x-axis
with different lines for the different isolated and cluttered conditions. For
this plot, use the original `popout_data` rather than the log transformed data
in order to make the y-axis scale more interpretable (i.e., the y-axis scale
will be in terms of milliseconds rather than log milliseconds).

Also, try to make the plot look nice by making sure the labels are meaningful
and choose a decent color scheme. Based on the this visualization, does there
seem to be an interaction between position and isolated/cluttered conditions?



```{r interaction_plot}








```

**Answer**: 






$\\$






### Part 2.4 (4 points): Testing interactions effects


Now fit a model has both the main effects and an interaction effect for position
and isolated/cluttered condition. Are the main effects and interaction term
statistically significant? What do you conclude?


```{r two_way_interaction}








```

**Answer**: 







$\\$







### Part 2.5 (6 points): Checking ANOVA assumptions


In order for our inferences to be valid, the assumptions underlying the ANOVA
should be met. Please check these assumptions now and report whether they appear
to be met.



```{r two_way_assumptions}







```

**Answer**






$\\$





### Part 2.6 (7 points)

Please explore some other aspect of the experiment to see if you can gain
additional insight by creating at least one additional plot, and by running one
additional ANOVA. For example, there are many other variables in the original
data frame that you could explore to see how they affect reaction times, some of
which have big effects. You could also run a "repeated measures" ANOVA where you
treat each participant as a factor to see how reaction times differ between
participants. We can discuss repeated measure ANOVAs more in class as well.

Once you have figured out an interesting analysis, describe what your plot and
ANOVA results show in the answer section (e.g., comment on any statistically
significant relationships you see).



```{r additional_exploration}














```


**Answer**








$\\$




## Part 3: Thoughts on your final project (5 points)

Describe what you are planning on doing for your final project. Also, load the
data you will use in your project in the R chunk below and print out the first
few rows of the data you are using (e.g., by using the `head()` function). As
mentioned before, I encourage you to email TA's and ULA's, or to talk to me if
you need any help with your project.
