## Part 1: Simple linear regression

As you likely know, former president Donald Trump claims that the 2020 election
was stolen from him due to election fraud. While the courts and most experts are
confident that the 2020 election was fair, perhaps other US elections did indeed
fail to truly reflect the will of the people. Let's explore this question using
data from the 2000 US presidential election which was one of the closest US
presidential elections.

In 2000, the US presidential election was between a Yale alumnus, George W. Bush
who was the Republican candidate, and a Harvard alumnus Al Gore who was the
Democratic candidate. There were also a number of "third-party" candidates such
as Princeton alumnus Ralph Nader who was the Green Party candidate, and
Georgetown alumnus Pat Buchanan who was the Reform Party candidate.

The code chunk below contains data from the 2000 election for the state of
Florida in a data frame called `florida_data`. Each observational unit in this
data frame contains information from one of the 67 counties in Florida including
demographic information on each county as well as the votes received by each
candidate in each county.

In the exercises below, you will use linear regression to look at the
relationship between the votes that the Republican candidate *George W. Bush*
received and the votes that the Reform candidate *Patrick Buchanan* received.


```{r, election0}

load('florida_votes_2000.rda')

dim(florida_data)

```






$\\$






**Part 1.1 (6 points):**  


Start the analysis by creating a scatter plot of the number of votes that Pat
Buchanan received as a function of the votes that George Bush received. Please
use *base R graphics* for this plot and all subsequent plots on this homework.

Once you have created this plot, fit a linear model that can predict the number
of votes Buchanan should receive given the number of votes that Bush received,
and add the regression line to this plot in red. In the answer section below
describe notable features of this graph (i.e., describe trends and unusual
points in the plot).


```{r, election1}










```

**Answers**: 








$\\$






**Part 1.2 (5 points):**


Now extract the coefficients from the linear model and print them. In the answer
section below, report how many votes Buchanan is expected to get for every 1,000
votes Bush received, and how many votes the model predicts that Buchanan would
have gotten if Bush had received 0 votes. Also, write an equation that predicts
the number of votes Buchanan should get as a function of the number of votes
Bush received. Make sure to use use $LaTeX$ for the equation and that you use
the proper notation discussed in class.



```{r, election2}




```



**Answers**: 







$\\$







**Part 1.3 (12 points):**

From looking at the plot above, it should be clear that there is one extreme outlier (i.e., one outlier that is much larger than all the others). To see this more clearly, create a box plot of the residuals of the model below. Then report answers to the following questions, **using the appropriate notation discussed in class for each number reported**:

1. What is the county that the outlier corresponds to? 

2. How many votes did Buchanan actually received in that county?

3. What is the predicted number of votes that Buchanan should have received for
this county based on the regression model fit above for that county?

4. What is the value of the residual for this county?

Please be sure to "show your work" by showing the code you used to come to
answers to these questions in the code chunk below. Hint: the `which.max()`
function could be useful, and if you save your linear model to an object called
`lm_fit`, then extracting values from this object, such as `lm_fit$residuals`,
will also be useful.

Finally, use the Internet to come up with a reasonable explanation that could
have led to this outlier (embedding images in the markdown document could be
useful here as well).



```{r, election3}


















```


**Answers**

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 









$\\$







**Part 1.4 (8 points):**


Suppose that in the outlier county, Buchanan received exactly the number of
votes predicted by the regression model, and the residual number of votes
Buchanan received in that county were intended to be votes for Al Gore. To
examine the consequences of this, start by calculating the total number of votes
Bush received and the total number of votes Gore received. Then add the residual
number of Buchanan votes from the outlier county to the total number of votes
that Gore received. Fill in these values in the R Markdown table below to report
these numbers. If the residual votes Buchanan received had indeed been intended
for Gore, would this have changed who got the majority number of votes in
Florida (and hence who would have won Florida)?


```{r, election4}






```


**Answers** 



Bush votes | Gore + res  |  Gore votes |
-----------|-------------|-------------|
           |             |             |




$\\$







**Part 1.5 (4 points):**

The United States uses the Electoral College system. In this system, the
candidate who gets the majority of the vote in a state wins all the Electoral
College votes for that state (at least for most of the states in the US,
including Florida). Use the Internet to find the number of Electoral College
votes Bush received in 2000. Based on the number of Electoral College votes that
Florida had, would there have been a different outcome of the election if Gore
had won Florida?

Bonus (0 points), report any possible policy differences that might have been
enacted had Gore been elected.

## Part 2: Statistical inference on regression coefficients


On July 3rd 2015, my 1999 Toyota Corolla broke down on the side of the highway
outside of Sturbridge, MA. While I had the car repaired, I knew it was time to
sell it and get a new car. I intended to sell my Corolla to the car dealership,
the only catch was that I was not sure how much the used Corolla was worth. In
the following exercises we will model how much a used Corolla is worth as a
function of the number of miles it has been driven.

The data we will look at comes from Edmunds.com which is a website where you can
buy new and used cars online. This data set is from the 2015 DataFest
competition, which is an undergraduate data science competition that takes place
at difference colleges across the United States. The data has been made
available to this class for educational purposes, however **please do not share this data outside of the class**.





$\\$





**Part 2.1 (8 points)**: Let's start by loading the `car_transactions` data set
using the code below. Report how many cases and variables the full data set has
in the answer section below. Then use the dplyr `select()` and `filter()`
functions to create a reduced data frame object called `used_corollas` in which:

1. The only variables that should be in the `used_corollas` data frame are: 

 a. `model_bought`: the model of the car 
 b. `new_or_used_bought`: whether a car was new or used when it was purchased
 c. `price_bought`: the price the car was purchased for
 d. `mileage_bought`: the number of miles the car had when it was purchased


2. The only cases that should be in the `used_corollas` data frame are: 

 a. Used cars
 b. Toyota Corollas
 c. Cars that have been driven less than 150,000 miles


3. Finally use the `na.omit()` function on the `used_corollas` data frame to
remove cases that have missing values.

Print out the number of rows and columns in this data frame to show you have the
correct answer. If you have properly filtered the data, the resulting data set
should have 248 cases, so check this is the case before going on to the next set
of exercises.



```{r get_used_corollas}


# load the data set
load("car_transactions.rda")













```

**Part 2.2 (10 points)**: 

Now that we have the relevant data, let's examine the relationship between a
car's price and the number of miles driven. Let's begin analyzing the data by
taking the following steps:

1. Plot the price as a function of the number of miles driven (again, use base R
graphics for all plots on this homework).

2. Fit a linear regression model that shows the predicted price as a function of
the number of miles driven. Save this model to an object called `lm_fit` which
you will use throughout the rest of this homework.

3. Add a red line to our plot showing the regression line fit. 

4. Print the regression coefficients found. 


Report how much the price of a Corolla decreases for every additional mile it
has been driven, and what this regression model suggests a car that has been
driven 0 miles would be worth. Also describe whether the the sign and magnitude
of these regression coefficient values match what you might expect for car
prices. Finally, write out the regression equation. Again, make sure to use use
$LaTeX$ for the equation and that you use the proper notation discussed in
class.


```{r car_regression}

















```


**Answers**: 










$\\$






**Part 2.3 (6 points)**: Now use R's `summary()` function to report whether
there is statistically significant evidence that the price of a car decreases as
a function of the number of miles driven. Also, write out the hypothesis that is
being tested using the appropriate symbols/notation discussed in class.


```{r car_inference}





```



**Answer** 






$\\$





**Part 2.4 (6 points)**: We can create confidence intervals using a
t-distribution via the `confint()` function. Report what the confidence interval
for the slope of the regression line is. Also, based on the confidence interval,
explain why it seems likely that the price of a car is not independent of the
number of miles driven.


```{r car_CI}






```

**Answer** 







$\\$







**Part 2.5 (6 points)**: 

We can also use the bootstrap to create confidence intervals for the slope of
the regression coefficient. To do this you can use the following procedure:

1. Create a bootstrap resampled data frame by sampling with replacement from the
`used_corollas` data frame. You can do this using dplyr's `sample_n()` function
with the sample size being the number of cases in the `used_corollas` data frame
and setting the `replace = TRUE` argument.

2. Fit the regression model using the bootstrap data frame.

3. Extract the regression slope coefficient and save it to a vector object. 

4. Repeat this process 1,000 times (this is less than what we normally use
because it is computationally expensive to run this bootstrap procedure).

5. Plot the bootstrap distribution and use the "percentile method" to report a
95% confidence interval for the regression slope; i.e., use the `quantile()`
function to get the confidence interval for the regression slope.


Report whether the bootstrap confidence interval is similar to the confidence
interval using the t-distribution you calculated above.




```{r boot_reg}















```

**Part 2.6 (8 points)**:  My Toyota had 180,000 miles at the time I wanted to
sell it. Based on the regression model fit above, what is the predicted worth of
this car? Also, in the answer section below, discuss if this seem like a
reasonable estimate.


```{r car_value_prediction}






```



**Answer**

## Part 3: Regression diagnostics


When making inferences about regression coefficients using parametric
(t-statistic based) methods, there are a number of assumptions that need to be
met to make the mathematical derivations of tests/confidence intervals methods
valid. The assumptions are:

1. **Linearity**: A line can describe the relationship between x and y.
2. **Independence**: Each data point is independent from the other points.
3. **Normality**: The errors are normally distributed.
4. **Equal variance (homoscedasticity)**: The variance of the errors is constant over the whole range of x values.


We can check whether these assumptions appear to be met by creating a set of diagnostic plots. 





$\\$






**Part 3.1 (5 points):** To check for linearity and equal variance of errors
(conditions 1 and 4 above), we can create a plot of the residuals
as a function of the fitted values. Create such a plot below using information
in the `lm_fit` object. Does it appear that the linearity and homoscedasticity
conditions are met? Are these results what you would expect from looking at
plots above and from the nature of the type of data you are analyzing?


```{r homoscedasticity}





```


**Answers:** 







$\\$






**Part 3.2 (4 points):** To check whether the residuals are normally distributed
(condition 3 above) we can create a Q-Q plot. The `car` package has a nice
function called `qqPlot()` to create these plots. If we pass the `lm_fit` object
to the `qqPlot()` function it will create a Q-Q plot of the studentized
residuals. Create this plot and report if the residuals seem normally
distributed.


```{r qqplot}




```


**Answer:** 





$\\$







**Part 3.3 (5 points):** To check if the data points are independent (condition
2 above) requires knowledge of how the data was collected. For example, if the
data you have is from a time-series (e.g., recordings of the temperature in New
Haven on consecutive days) then there is a high likelihood that the data points
might not be independent. On the other hand, if you take a simple random sample
from a population where every point is equally likely to be selected, then the
data is going to be independent.

Unfortunately I do not know exactly how this data was collected so it is
difficult to say if the data is independent here. However, there might be ways
to investigate whether it seems plausible that it could be independent. Please
describe some ways you might investigate whether the data could be independent
(hint: think about the variables in the full `car_transactions` data set). Note:
there is no exact 'right answer' here, just describe some possible ideas.
