 * Hypothesis tests for two means

## Part 1: Running a randomization test for a single proportion in R

#### Part 1.1: Is it possible to smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease? 


Joy Milne claimed to have the ability to smell whether someone had Parkinson’s disease.

To test this claim, researchers gave Joy 6 shirts that had been worn by people who had Parkinson’s disease and 6 people who did not.

Joy identified 11 out of the 12 shirts correctly. 

Let's run a hypothesis test to assess whether there is significant evidence to suggest that Joy can really could smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease.

##### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words, and set up the rules of the game


**In words:** 

* Null hypothesis: 
* Alternative hypothesis: 



**Using symbols**





**Rules of the game**







$\\$





##### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r joy_obs_stat}



```





$\\$





##### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist}






```






$\\$






##### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value}



```






$\\$






##### Step 5: Make a decision









$\\$






**Questions**

 1. Do you believe Joy can really smell Parkinson's disease? 
 
    - What about after [you read this article](https://wapo.st/2lW9GQL)? 

 2. Is it better to report the actual p-value or just whether we rejected the null hypothesis $H_0$?

## Part 2: Permutation tests for comparing two means in R


Let's us examine the randomized controlled trial experiment by Solomon et al
(2002) to see if there is evidence that taking a gingko pills improves memory. To
read the original paper see:

### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 






$\\$






### Step 2a: Plot the data


```{r pill_plot}


load("gingko_RCT.rda")



# plot the data





# create a stripchart








```






$\\$






### Step 2b: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r pill_obs_stat}





```


$\\$





### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist_pill}


# combine the data from the treatment and placebo groups together




# use a for loop to create shuffled treatment and placebo groups and shuffled statistics 


       # shuffle data
        

        # create fake treatment and control groups
       

        # save the statistic of interest






# plot the null distribution as a histogram







```






$\\$







### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value_pill}


# plot the null distribution again with a red line a the value of the observed statistic









# calculate the p-value






```




$\\$



### Step 5: Make a decision
