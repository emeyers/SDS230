## Part 1: Connections between ANOVA and regression 


Let's look at connections between the least squares fit we used when fitting
linear regression models and our one-way ANOVA.



$\\$


```{r load_IPED_data}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

load("IPED_salaries_2016.rda")

IPED_2 <- IPED_salaries |>
  filter(endowment > 0) |>
  mutate(log_salary = log10(salary_tot)) |>
  filter(CARNEGIE %in% c(15, 31)) |>
  filter(rank_name %in% c("Assistant", "Associate", "Full")) |>
  group_by(school) |>
  mutate(num_ranks = n()) |>
  filter(num_ranks == 3)     # only use schools that have all three ranks


# could look at the log salary instead...
# IPED_2$salary_tot <- IPED_2$log_salary

dim(IPED_2)


# visualize the data
IPED_2 |>
  ggplot(aes(rank_name, salary_tot, col = rank_name)) + 
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = .2)) + 
  xlab("Faculty rank") + 
  ylab("Salary ($)")


```





$\\$




### Step 1.1: Least squares offsets are the group means


Let's look at the mean salary for each rank and compare it to the
least squares offsets that the `lm()` function finds.


```{r least_squares_means}


# fit a linear model 
fit_salary <- lm(salary_tot ~ rank_name, data = IPED_2)


# check that the least squares fit offsets are the means of each group
(summary_salary <- summary(fit_salary))

fit_coefs <- coef(fit_salary)


# predicted salaries for each faculty rank (Full, Associate and Assistant) 
c(fit_coefs[1], fit_coefs[1] + fit_coefs[2], fit_coefs[1] + fit_coefs[3])



# get the mean and sd of the salary for each faculty rank
IPED_stats <- IPED_2 |>
  group_by(rank_name) |>
  summarize(mean_salary = mean(salary_tot),
            sd_salary = sd(salary_tot))


# the mean value of each rank is what the model predicts
IPED_stats$mean_salary


```



$\\$




### Step 1.2: Using R to get an ANOVA table and diagnostic plots


We can use the `anova()` function to create an ANOVA table, and we can use the
`plot()` function to look at diagnostic plots to make sure our ANOVA conditions
have been met.



```{r}


# an easy way to get the ANOVA table using the ANOVA function 
(anova_table <- anova(fit_salary))


# we can use regression diagnostic plots to assess if ANOVA conditions have been met
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit_salary)


# we should also check that the maximum and minimum standard deviations are not greater 
# than a factor of 2 apart
IPED_stats$sd_salary
max(IPED_stats$sd_salary)/min(IPED_stats$sd_salary)




```




$\\$






###  Part 1.3 Kruskal–Wallis test to see if any of our groups stochastically dominate another group. 

If we are concerned that our one-way ANOVA conditions are not met, we can run a
Kruskal–Wallis test which does not rely on the assumptions of normality and
homoscedasticity. We could also run a permutation test which does not rely on
these assumptions either.


```{r}

#Kruskal–Wallis test
kruskal.test(salary_tot ~ rank_name, data = IPED_2)


# compare to the ANOVA 
anova(fit_salary)


```





$\\$






## Part 2: Pairwise comparisons after running a one-way ANOVA



If we run a one-way ANOVA and the results are statistically significant, there
are a number of tests we can run to see which pairs of results are significantly
different.



```{r}


# test with no multiple comparisons adjustment (not great)



# with the Bonferroni correction



# Note, the Bonferroni p-values are 3 times larger than the p-values with no adjustment



# Tukey's HSD test using the TukeyHSD() function 
# It is giving results similar to the Bonferroni correction





```






$\\$











## Part 3: Two-way ANOVA 


Let's use a two-way ANOVA to examine if ants are more attracted to particular
types of sandwiches! This is a balanced design because there are the same number
of observations at each factor level combination (in this case there are 4
observations at each factor combination level).





$\\$






### Part 3.1.: Visualizing the data


Let's start by visualizing the data (you can practice stating the null and
alternative hypotheses on the homework).






```{r}

# install.packages("Stat2Data")

library(Stat2Data)

data(SandwichAnts)


# visualize the data




# Two-way interaction plot using base R






```






$\\$







### Part 3.2.: Fitting the model


Let's now use a two-way ANOVA to run a hypothesis test to see if the differences
are statistically significant.



```{r}


# Create a main effects only model




# Order doesn't matter for a balanced design




# Could look at diagnostic plots




```




$\\$







## Part 4: Examening unbalanced data


In an unbalanced data, there are different numbers of measured responses at the
different variable levels. When running an ANOVA on unbalanced data, one needs
to be careful because there are different ways to calculate the sum of squares
for the different factors, and this can lead to different results about which
factors are statistically significant. Let's examine this using the IPED faculty
salary data.


```{r}


# Factor A: lecturer, assistant, associate, full professor
# Factor B: liberal arts vs research university 

IPED_3 <- IPED_salaries |>
  filter(rank_name %in% c("Lecturer", "Assistant", "Associate", "Full")) |>
  mutate(rank_name  = droplevels(rank_name)) |>
  filter(CARNEGIE %in% c(15, 31)) |>
 # na.omit() |>
  mutate(Inst_type = dplyr::recode(CARNEGIE, "31" = "Liberal arts", "15" = "Research extensive"))


# examine properties of the data 
table(IPED_3$Inst_type, IPED_3$rank_name)


```






$\\$






### Part 4.1.: Type I sum of squares

In type I sum of squares, the sum of squares are calculated sequentially, where
first SSA is taken into account, and then SSB is consider. In particular:

* Factor A sum of squares is: SS(A) from fitting lm(y ~ A)
* Factor B sum of squares is: SS(B|A) from fitting lm(y ~ A + B) and subtracting this from SS(A)
* The interaction AB sum of squares is: SS(A, B, AB) - SS(A, B); i.e., the model is fit will lm(y ~ A*B) and then SS(A, B) is subtracted. 


```{r}

# Create a main effects and interaction model







```






$\\$






### Part 4.2.: Type III sum of squares


In type III sum of squares, the sum of squares the full model is fit SS(A, B,
AB) and then the sum of squares for each factor is determined by taking the full
model SS(A, B, AB) and subtracting out the fit when a given factor is missing.

* Factor A sum of squares is: SS(A, B, AB) - SS(B, AB)
* Factor B sum of squares is: SS(A, B, AB) - SS(A, AB)
* The interaction AB sum of squares is: SS(A, B, AB) - SS(A, B)


```{r}

# type III sum of squares the order that variables are added does not matter






```
