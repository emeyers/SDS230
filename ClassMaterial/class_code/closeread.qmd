title: Experiment with Closeread
format: closeread-html

To get the [Closeread](https://closeread.dev/) extension to work, you need to run the following command in the terminal (bottom tab near the console).

1. Make sure the terminal is in the same directory as this .qmd file.
2. Run the following command in the terminal: `quarto add qmd-lab/closeread`

This should create a `_extensions` directory that has the javascript code needed to run the closeread document.



If this doesn't work you might have to start a new terminal by going to Tools at the top of the RStudio menu, then click on terminal, then click on new terminal. 

You might also need to install Quarto if it has not already been installed with RStudio. You can install Quarto from [this webpage](https://quarto.org/docs/download/)




<!--  Please run the code in the  R chunk below once. This will download data 
and images needed for these exercises.  -->

## Closeread basics


Let's start with a basic close read section `{.cr-section}` where we scroll text over an R graphic.

## Highlighting


Let's now explore highlighting text and code. 

As always, we start by wrapping everything in a `{.cr-section}`.

Let's first highlight some code, and then let's highlight some text. 




::::{.cr-section}







:::{#cr-dplyr}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE, echo = TRUE}

library(dplyr)

  group_by(mtcars, am) |>
    summarize(avg_wt = mean(wt))

```

| {#cr-limerick}
| There once was a coder named [Claire]{#cr-claire},
| Whose scripts worked by luck and a [prayer]{#cr-prayer}.
|   When she coded in R,
|   Her results were bizarreâ€”
| But her plots were a work of great [flair]{#cr-flair}!

## Zooming


Let's now explore zooming in on a specific part an image.


As always, we start by wrapping everything in a `{.cr-section}`.

Let's first zoom in on the histogram from the previous section.
